This repo contains files for analyzing 4 different datasets and exporting results in a text file.

- PyBank includes script for analyzing simple financial records (Date and Profit/Losses)
- PyPoll includes script for analyzing a set of poll data (Voter ID, County, and Candidate)
- PyBoss includes script that convert stored employee records into the required format (i.e. first name and last name as separate columns, displaying only last 4 digit of SSN, etc.)
- PyParagraph includes script that assesses complexity of various passages of writing (e.g. approximate word count and sentence count, average letter count and sentence length). 

Note: In PyParagraph, a function has been created to make code reusable. Two examples (paragraph_1.txt and paragraph_2.txt) are provided. Comment out one or the other to obtain results for each text file.
